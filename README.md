# Scraping
Within the framework of the project I scraped a Web page of one of Armenia's telecommunication companies.
As my company's proxy server block the variety of websites,
I decided with my colleague to download web page as html file and then proceed on scraping. 
R was the most convenient tool for this purpose.
